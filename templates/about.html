                        As we embark on the journey of planning your wedding, we'll also be building a wonderful friendship! So, allow us to share a bit about our owner and head coordinator, Ryan Bergstrom. Ryan's passion for event planning ignited during his college years when he founded an Art Gallery and served as a chair member of the Providence Art Association. He found joy in hosting gala events to spotlight artists from New England. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Ryan's career took an exciting turn when he became a Chief Steward on super yachts (think Below Deck! He was even almost a part of the show!). For about 4-5 years, he meticulously planned every detail of his guests' once-in-a-lifetime experiences. After orchestrating events in 15 different countries, Ryan felt the call to return to the beautiful Midwest.
                        Since settling on land in 2022, Ryan has planned over 100 weddings and private events, contributing to his overall tally of more than 250 events worldwide.
